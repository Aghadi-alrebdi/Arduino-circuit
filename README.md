## Project Title  
**Design of a 3-Button LED Control Circuit in Tinkercad**

---

## Objective  
The goal of this project is to design a digital input/output control system using Tinkercad, in which **three push buttons** are used to control **three LEDs** via an Arduino Uno. The simulation demonstrates basic microcontroller I/O operations, where pressing a button turns on a specific LED and turns off the others.

## Description  
The circuit is built using three buttons and three LEDs connected to an Arduino:

- **Button 1** (Pin 7) controls **LED 1** (Pin 10)  
- **Button 2** (Pin 8) controls **LED 2** (Pin 11)  
- **Button 3** (Pin 9) controls **LED 3** (Pin 12)

Each button is connected. When a button is pressed, its corresponding LED turns on while the other two LEDs are turned off. This ensures that **only one LED is active at a time**, based on the last button pressed.

A heartbeat LED is also added on pin 13, which blinks periodically to indicate that the microcontroller is running.
